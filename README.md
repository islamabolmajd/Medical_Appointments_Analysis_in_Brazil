we could try to ask many questions here and we hope to get the answer :
does recieving a SMS resuled more paitients to show in the scheduled day ?
does Alcoholisim affect people showing in the scheduled day ?
does hipertension affect paitient show rate ?
does diabetes affect paitient show rate ?
what is the show rate of paitients with handcaps ?
the most important four question are :
what are the distribution of the age in each gender?
does a specific gender have a higher show rate ?
what are the neighbourhoods that paitients like to show in it ?
does people with Scholarship show more ?
is there any day of the week that had a significant show rate ?Â¶
